- Use the two programs to change develop understanding of Global Variables, setup(), draw(), and listener or mouseClick()
  - Variables used when code repeats (like circleDiamter for face, eyes, measles; red colout
  - Laying is emphasized with what shapes to draw first
  - Quit-Button can use a hover-over (introduce decision for fill colours)
  - Quit-Button will be included in Boilerplate as procedure (introducing code written once and used where-ever)
