Beginning Notes
Common Image Scripts
color blue = #0E43C4;
background(blue);
loading images to arrays (odd numbers only, including zero)
load scale of image to even indexes (example of data structure)
PImage[] pic = new PImage[3]; //3 is index, changable; pic.length
PImage pic0, pic1, pic2; //Good intermediate understanding
//Be rediculaous and try to make 25 variable name
pic[0] = loadImage("ObiOneThumb.jpg");
image(pic1, 0,0,width,height/4); //Same as rect() layout
Array minilesson: 
Need mini lesson on aspect rations
Need Padding (inside element or rectangle), as variable, similar to rect in rect like the quitButton
Need Spacing (outisde element or rectangle), easy to move around if spacing rectangels
Need scale as mulitpler of image to fit inside the rect
Need Aspect Ration Calculator (compare incoming image to width and height of rect
- if bigger, use FOR Loop find multiplier
- when fits, save multiplier to correct index-even matched number

Extra Scripts
tint() & noTint() to reset default

Extending Lessons
Create a chessboard - nested FOR Loops
When printing images to a screen, able to use a FOR Loop if "grid coordinates are known

Picking from a random array element
int c5 = (int)random(0, 4);); //random returns a float, int truncates it (test this)
or 
int c5 = (int)random(pic.length); //does not pick the last one, does include zero

Image Calculator
- no turning images
- scale a length, figure percent
- scale height, figure percent
- compare scales, find larger
- remulitple with larger scale
