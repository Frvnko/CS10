Need to complete the Aspect Ratio maths before are able to 
automate code

CAUTION: FOR Loops do calculations after the condition
Note: the condition must stop any further calculations

Use WHILE Loops, not FOR Loops
- Increment at the end of the WHILE Loop
- Condition is at the end of the Loop

General Algorithm
1. Find dimensions of image, record
2. Find dimensions of canvas or rect() to put image into
3. Divide to get Scale Enlargement or Reduction
   - Canvas or rect() / Image
   - Returns number that "makes sense" larger than 1 to enlarge,
     smaller to reduce
   - Note: computers do not store decimals very well, creates memory issues
4. Pick the scale
   - Elementary: enlarge, pick smaller number; reduction, pick larger
   - Junior High: pick the number closer to one using subtraction (-'ves)
   - High School: use abs funtion & always pick the smaller positive #
5. Create scaled dimenions
6. Test to see if they fit
7. If not, reduce by a percentage using a WHILE Loop
   Note: FOR Loop tests and then does another calculation for reduction
   WHILE does not, tests at the end
6. Print Image
