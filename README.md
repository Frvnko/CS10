See Creating a Repository in GitHub: https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/blob/master/Projects/Creating%20a%20GitHub%20Repository.txt
- Main Goals
   1. Using GitHub Account and Creating a Repository
   2. Routine for putting initial files inside and what these might be used for

## Major Projects: Planning Algorithms and Semester Planning
Websites Unit, Introduction to HTML5
- Main Goals
  1. GitHub Markdown, with Additional HTML rendered in GitHub ReadMe.md files. Note, other programs use Markdown for formatting a variety of messages. Markdown is much easier to use if you are used to it or have a "Summary Sheet".
     - "Opens a students world to a new type of formatting."
     - "Project External Documentation"
  2. Creating Single Page Applications (static or dynamic websites)
     - Goal: host at least one through GitHub Website Hosting, further introduction to Google Analytics and Keywords to link to searches
     - Using HTML & inline CSS
     - "The front end of project promotion."
  3. Modern Examples of Websites worth researching and learning how to code
     - Chrome Extensions: HTML5 (often simple JavaScript), make browser do more
     - PWA: Progressive Web Apps, websites that feel like native Android Apps
     - Note: can deploy PWAs through Chrome Extension package (Google This)
- Introduction to GitHub Repositories & ReadMe.md files (External Documentation using GitHub Markdown)
   - External Documentation Pieces for Case Study
      - Repository Name (done when repository made)
      - Title (can be changed or added)
      - Date
      - Author
      - 10 Word Summary (done when repository made)
      - 50 Word Description
      - Key words, based on summaries, to include with Google Analytics
      - To Do List, ordered in priority, with way to record items done (See Markdown Repository for more explanation)
      - Additional Images to see (i.e. links to Google Drive, other social media, or located in GitHub Repository)
      - Additional instructional, etc. videos (i.e. links to YouTube)
      - Note: include all references to external websites: URL & Date Accessed
- Choose a Project and create a promotional website for it
   - "Who Am I": UNESCO-style website answering who I am as a culturally-based Canadian Citizen
   - "Writing Project": take a writing project (paragraph or essay) and create an interactive website illustrating writing through definitions, images, videos, and linked web documents (other webpages)
     - Exemplar: Social 30 Essay about World War II ("Holocaust")
- Optional: 3D JavaScript through Chrome, individual work or Project Work Only
- Optional: Introduction to Inspecting Elements searching for ideas

## Website Lessons (Note: all outcomes from CSS1)
Approximate time: 3 weeks

Introductions to a Browser - Specifically Google Chrome (and other exist)
1. "What else can a browser do?"
   - https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-browser-notepad/, accessed 20180905
   - A Browser can be a notepad tool, as long as the tab stays open
   - Type the following code into the URL Bar

   ```html
   data:text/html, <html contenteditable>
   ```

   - Uses built-in defaults for font, size, and other formatting rules
   - Google will spell check all the typing
   - If Chrome saves tabs (in settings, "Start where you left off"), or you use Workona, Tab will remain ready for notes but typing will disappear

2. Pathways inside a computer
   - Windows, Folders, and Pathways

3. Pathways outside a computer: URLs in name or number
   - Learning how to read URLs
   - Local Scripting: see example of Browser Notepad
   - Local Hosting: see example of World War II Essay on the Holocaust
   - Client-server hosting: see below

Exploring & Illustrating Internet and Web Docs Architecture
- Main Skill Goal: Using CMD through Windows to sending "Packets" or Internet Messages
- Main Concept Goal: diagram image of Internet Architecture (Google Draw, Paper and Pencil, other methods)
  1. One diagram for all vocabulary
  2. Internet Client-Server Requests through 2 stub networks (2x switches with single router)
- Main Vocabulary for Client-server relationships of Real (MAC) Addressing and Logical Addressing
  - workstations & NIC Cards (real MAC Address)
  - stub networks (defined by 1 workstation & switch or 1 workstation & router)
  - LANs defined by switch
  - WANs defined by router (edge router)
  - MANs defined by region or provider
  - Backbone of Internet defined by "in the wild" routers
- Main Vocabulary for Internet Services Requests ("all at once" (Netflix), packets (checked))
  - DNS
  - Pathways
