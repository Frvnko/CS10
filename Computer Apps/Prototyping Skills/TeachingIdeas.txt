Need
Gather code reviewed in 2D Shapes
Discuss vocabulary and ideas with code
Create one-page handouts for these
See Alternate Cue Cards Assignment for Coding Concepts
- In SP2 Final Assignment (leads to Intermediate CS)

For Example
2D Images PsuedoCode to full program
- rect(), ellipse (), line()
- size, width, height, operations to get coordinates
- fullScreen(), Print(), displayWidth, displayHeight, fractions & ratios
- fill(), noFill(), noStroke(), stroke()

Concepts with these examples
- Drawing 2d Shapes creating a form
- Layering 2D Shapes to create perspective or action
- Printing text in rectangles (i.e. DIVs in a webpage)
- AUtomatically sizing font for text in a webpage
- Creating mouse-click buttons with hover-over effects, like a quit button

- Inserting images with and without aspect ration
- Using effects like tint and transparency

Images (needs WHILE Loops, FOR Loops gets too complicated
- what are the calcualtor steps to make these calculations
  to make the image bigger or smaller
- these steps are repeated
- these repeatitions are a FOR Loop
- Students do this all the time with Guess and Check
