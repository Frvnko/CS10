# Ideas to Include
- Create Happy Face with ratios, linear program (Purpose: GUI Design)
- Review with Paper Folding Activity (fractions to 16th)
- Create Quit-Button, with ratios, linear program (Purpose: GUI Design)
  - Start with Paper Folding Activity, try to get top left courner (same as X in WINDOWS)
- Use the two programs to change develop understanding of Global Variables, setup(), draw(), and listener or mouseClick()
  - Variables used when code repeats (like circleDiamter for face, eyes, measles; red colour
  - Laying is emphasized with what shapes to draw first
  - Quit-Button can use a hover-over (introduce decision for fill colours)
  - Quit-Button will be included in Boilerplate as procedure (introducing code written once and used where-ever)
Happy Face Variables and Comments to make code readable
- Reminders
  - size() will separate declarations and assignments
  - variables with random() assignments will also need to be in the correct void
- Advanced: creating TABS and procedures to decrease the amount of typing
- Extra Code for Happy Face, Measles
  - Use Processing.org to figure these out, <a href="https://processing.org/reference/">Click Here for the Reference Page</a>
  - strokeWieght()
  - noStroke() & stroke()
  - Explore other processing functions for drawing face (research)
- Measles Program will break without proper declarations and assignments ( after setup and inside draw() )

Teaching Strategy: 3 Java Compiler needs to run a program (demonstration with no words)
Teaching Strategy: demo with no words: layering the eye (use

  Need
Gather code reviewed in 2D Shapes
Discuss vocabulary and ideas with code
Create one-page handouts for these
See Alternate Cue Cards Assignment for Coding Concepts
- In SP2 Final Assignment (leads to Intermediate CS)


For Example
2D Images PsuedoCode to full program
- rect(), ellipse (), line()
- size, width, height, operations to get coordinates
- fullScreen(), Print(), displayWidth, displayHeight, fractions & ratios
- fill(), noFill(), noStroke(), stroke()

2D Text
See DOCs in Folder

2D Images
See DOCs in Folder

Concepts with these examples
- Drawing 2d Shapes creating a form
- Layering 2D Shapes to create perspective or action
- Printing text in rectangles (i.e. DIVs in a webpage)
- Automatically sizing font for text in a webpage
- Creating mouse-click buttons with hover-over effects, like a quit button

- Inserting images with and without aspect ration
- Using effects like tint and transparency

Images (needs WHILE Loops, FOR Loops gets too complicated
- what are the calculator steps to make these calculations
  to make the image bigger or smaller
- these steps are repeated
- these repetitions are a FOR Loop
- Students do this all the time with Guess and Check

Final Exam: Music Player
- GUI design: mix of mouse-based (touch screen) buttons with 2D Shapes creating user experience
- Understanding how a MAIN file will organize code, in a general sense
  - Global Variables, Local Variables
  - Java Compiler requirements: Folder Name, void setup(), and void draw()
  - Additional Listeners: keyPressed, mouseClicked, etc.
- Demonstrating general behaviors:
  - play & pause
  - stop
  - next & previous
  - organization of multiple songs
  - organization of sound effects
- Using prototyped programs and lessons to build similarly coded features from Case Study
- Incorporating text and images
- Utilizing ratios and program-display geometry in visual data rendering

Final Exam Alternates
- Side-loading main program to Android device (finishing the course with exploring content ownership, ethics, and device permissions)
- Creating a different project without project management from Mr. Mercer
