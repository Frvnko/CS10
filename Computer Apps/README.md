# Ideas to Include
- Create Happy Face with ratios, linear program (Purpose: GUI Design)
- Review with Paper Folding Activity (fractions to 16th)
- Create Quit-Button, with ratios, linear program (Purpose: GUI Design)
  - Start with Paper Folding Activity, try to get top left courner (same as X in WINDOWS)
- Use the two programs to change develop understanding of Global Variables, setup(), draw(), and listener or mouseClick()
  - Variables used when code repeats (like circleDiamter for face, eyes, measles; red colour
  - Laying is emphasized with what shapes to draw first
  - Quit-Button can use a hover-over (introduce decision for fill colours)
  - Quit-Button will be included in Boilerplate as procedure (introducing code written once and used where-ever)
Happy Face Variables and Comments to make code readable
- Reminders
  - size() will separate declarations and assignments
  - variables with random() assignments will also need to be in the correct void
- Advanced: creating TABS and procedures to decrease the amount of typing
- Extra Code for Happy Face, Measles
  - Use Processing.org to figure these out, <a href="https://processing.org/reference/">Click Here for the Reference Page</a>
  - strokeWieght()
  - noStroke() & stroke()
- Measles Program will break without proper declarations and assignments ( after setup and inside draw() )
