- Needs exporting and then embedding in a webpage
- Needs Ketai then Android Studio for Google Playhttps://www.google.ca/search?safe=strict&rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA751CA751&q=Youtube+daniel+shiffman&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwju8_D8vPHXAhVD7YMKHXX5C54QBQgjKAA&biw=1920&bih=949

Music Player Library
- Full of Subalgorithms
- Enabling sound in all future sketchs and canvases
- Including sound effects and music in "play anywhere" apps
  Refers to Operating System
- Apply IF Statements to Keyboard Listener
  Extends MousePressed
  Able to combine with Gr11 Collisions
  Do after if statements created
- Introduces switch-case-break-default for complicated if-else statements
- Will be able to insert music or sounds effects into projects

Lesson for Music Player
- Downloading Music
  Royalty Free Music?
  Google Youtube Audio Library
  https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music
  https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/soundeffects
  Able to use Music and Effects already downloaded
- Loading Music, need to control music by song title or string, difficult
- Loadign Music & Using Arrays: able to control song by number, arithemtic
- Playing a song in setup & illustrating an empty draw loop
- Setting up keypressed with cases and if statements
  Note: cases do not evaluate equalities or inequalities,
  Only an assignment of a varaible
- Error catch "Array Index Out of Bounds Error"
  Occurs: pressing previous or next button
  Develop reason why using subalgorithm
- Add keys for Effects Player
  Purpose: an effect is for a specific purpose (button, key, or event)

Questions to answer by coding
- Are tiles on the screen able to be stored in a linear function
  accessed by two FOR Loops

Notes
- If the name of the song is too long, use a substring function

CAUTION: Possible Errors, must have a check for this
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
- Error: /node/free: Node id -1 out or range
- pressing "back song" at the beginning should given an error
- Pressing "next song at the end should give an errror

Control of Console
A: previous song
S: play
D: next song
X: stop

Algorithms
- Syntax of Library
- Playing a song in setup()
- Adding key control to
  Play
  Stop
- Adding key control for next and previous
  CAUTION: will add error of Array Index out of Bounds
  Needs Error checking with simple arithmetic and .length function
