- Reveiw with Paper Folding Activity
- Create Quit-Button, with ratios, linear program (Purpose: GUI Design)

- Use the two programs to change develop understanding of GLobal Variables, setup(), draw(), amd listener or mouseClick()
  - Variables used when code repeats (like circleDiamter for face, eyes, measles; red colout
  - Laying is emphasized with what shapes to draw first
  - Quit-Button can use a hover-over (introduce decision for fill colours)
  - Quit-Button will be included in Boilerplate as procedure (introducing code written once and used where-ever)
