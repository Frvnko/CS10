## Major Projects: Planning Algorithms and Semester Planning

### Websites Unit, Introduction to HTML5
- Main Goals: Promotional Websites to Business-style Websites
  1. GitHub Markdown, with Additional HTML rendered in GitHub ReadMe.md files. Note, other programs use Markdown for formatting a variety of messages. Markdown is much easier to use if you are used to it or have a "Summary Sheet".
     - "Opens a students world to a new type of formatting."
     - "Project External Documentation"
  2. Creating Single Page Applications (static or dynamic websites)
     - Goal: host at least one through GitHub Website Hosting, further introduction to Google Analytics and Keywords to link to searches
     - Using HTML & inline CSS
     - "The front end of project promotion."
  3. Modern Examples of Websites, not promotional or business-style, worth researching and learning how to code
     - Chrome Extensions: HTML5 (often simple JavaScript), make browser do more
     - PWA: Progressive Web Apps, websites that feel like native Android Apps
     - Note: can deploy PWAs through Chrome Extension package (Google This)
- Introduction to GitHub Repositories & ReadMe.md files (External Documentation using GitHub Markdown)
   - External Documentation Pieces for Case Study
      - Repository Name (done when repository made)
      - Title (can be changed or added)
      - Date
      - Author
      - 10 Word Summary (done when repository made)
      - 50 Word Description
      - Key words, based on summaries, to include with Google Analytics
      - To Do List, ordered in priority, with way to record items done (See Markdown Repository for more explanation)
      - Additional Images to see (i.e. links to Google Drive, other social media, or located in GitHub Repository)
      - Additional instructional, etc. videos (i.e. links to YouTube)
      - Note: include all references to external websites: URL & Date Accessed
- Create two promotional websites
   - "Who Am I": UNESCO-style website answering who I am as a culturally-based Canadian Citizen, <a href="https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/Intro-Who-Am-I-Project">Click Here for Details</a>
   - "Writing Project": take a writing project (paragraph or essay) and create an interactive website illustrating writing through definitions, images, videos, and linked web documents (other webpages)
     - <a href="https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/Intro-Essay-Project">Click Here for Details</a>
     - Exemplar: Social 30 Essay about World War II ("Holocaust"), <a href="">Click Here for Details</a>
- Optional: 3D JavaScript through Chrome, individual work or Project Work Only
- Optional: Introduction to Inspecting Elements searching for ideas

### Computer Apps, Introduction to Processing-JAVA

## Website Lessons (Note: all outcomes from CSS1)
Approximate time: 3 weeks

### What is the Internet and Web Documents

Introductions to a Browser - Specifically Google Chrome (and other exist)
1. "What else can a browser do?"
   - https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-browser-notepad/, accessed 20180905
   - A Browser can be a notepad tool, as long as the tab stays open
   - Type the following code into the URL Bar

   ```html
   data:text/html, <html contenteditable>
   ```

   - Uses built-in defaults for font, size, and other formatting rules
   - Google will spell check all the typing
   - If Chrome saves tabs (in settings, "Start where you left off"), or you use Workona, Tab will remain ready for notes but typing will disappear

2. Pathways inside a computer
   - Windows, Folders, and Pathways

3. Pathways outside a computer: URLs in name or number
   - Learning how to read URLs
   - Local Scripting: see example of Browser Notepad
   - Local Hosting: see example of World War II Essay on the Holocaust
   - Client-server hosting: see below

Exploring & Illustrating Internet and Web Docs Architecture
- Main Skill Goal: Using CMD through Windows to sending "Packets" or Internet Messages
- Main Concept Goal: diagram image of Internet Architecture (Google Draw, Paper and Pencil, other methods)
  1. One diagram for all vocabulary
  2. Internet Client-Server Requests through 2 stub networks (2x switches with single router)
- Main Vocabulary for Client-server relationships of Real (MAC) Addressing and Logical Addressing
  - workstations & NIC Cards (real MAC Address)
  - stub networks (defined by 1 workstation & switch or 1 workstation & router)
  - LANs defined by switch
  - WANs defined by router (edge router)
  - MANs defined by region or provider
  - Backbone of Internet defined by "in the wild" routers
- Main Vocabulary for Internet Services Requests ("all at once" (Netflix), packets (checked))
  - DNS
  - Pathways
  - Browser
  - EMail Server
  - Print Server
- Main Commands Examples for CMD
  - /? | ?
  - ping
  - traceroute
  - nslookup
  - Note: https://www.cloudns.net/blog/10-most-used-nslookup-commands/, accessed 20180905

Brief Introduction to Web Documents Design: hypertext (HTTP & HTTPS)
- Ports for HTTP & HTTPS for IP Sockets
- Security Protocol of HTTPS

Introductions to Raspberry Pi, "Going Headless", and IP Sockets
- IP Sockets (IP Address : Port Number) needed to specify packet direction

### Introductory HTML with inline CSS as a Single Page Website Hosted Locally on a Machine using GitHub as the Version Control

### "Who am I" Project Main Sections
1. Brainstorm and Record Expectations: <a href="https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/Intro-Who-Am-I-Project#rubric--expectations">Click Here</a>
2. Case Study: minimum is an 11x17 with a box illustrating layout and descriptions around explaining content
   - Note: 2 pieces of paper might be easier to work with
     - 1 piece of paper for content (word lists, actual text, and ideas for images, videos, audio, and other media)
     - 1 piece of paper for layout
3. Creating a GitHub Repository for this Project, learning how to save URLs (& date accessed) with actual files
   - Create basic repository: see Creating a GitHub Repository, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/blob/master/Projects/Creating%20a%20GitHub%20Repository.txt">Click Here</a>
   - Create the main page called index.html (needed for GitHub Hosting), create a new `*.txt` document and rename it
   - Add basic boilerplate (typing html in empty .html through WYSIWYG)
   - Reminder: eventually Web DOCs will be saved here
     - Note: saving the URL into the REadMe.md file is less memory than saving the downloaded file
     - CAUTION: if the owner of the image takes it away, it will no longer be on your webpage
     - Solution: prioritize downloaded pieces and only save the ones you _really_ need
     - Alternate Solution: create a Google Drive Folder and copy URL to point webpage to
4. Create a To Do List in the ReadMe.md
   - Rewrite the case study into a sequence of items to do
   - Items must be in hierarchy, per element or feature: Order of Scroll should match reading a webpage "top to bottom" and "left to right"
   - Must submit Case Study, Must submit GitHub Link
   - Reminders
     - GitHub link to Markdown Review: <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation">Click Here</a>
5. Reinterpret Case Study into Scrollable Webpage HTML DOC
   - Add additional boilerplate to reimage webpage
   - Reminder: individual elements or features, that should be "left to right" will be that way after CSS Lessons
6. Setting up the Chrome Browser for HTML & CSS Validation
   a. HTML Validation
      - In Workona, point a TAB to https://validator.w3.org/
      - Able to validate hosted and local documents
   b. CSS Validation
      - In Workona, point a TAB to https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en
      - Able to validate hosted and local documents
   c. Accessibility Testing as a Chrome Developer Tool
      - In the Chrome Store, search for "aXe, Deque Systems" and add it to Chrome
      - In Chrome/Extensions Settings, allow aXe to access URLs
      - Able to find this in Developer Tools and the Analyze Button
7. HTML Lessons for the following HTML Features
   - HTML Tags must be included: `<html>, <head>, <body>`
   - `<head>`, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_head.asp">Click Here for W3 Schools Reference</a>
