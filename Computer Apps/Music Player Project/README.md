# Music Player - Potential to side-load to Android
Building a Music Player, including free or owned content

**All Projects moving forward should include sound effects, perhaps some music**

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Purpose: to design an Android App that plays music
- Important Buttons in the middle of the screen (where thumbs are)
  Play, Stop, Next Song, Previous Song
- Important information is near the top (where eyes are)
- Secondary information and buttons are near the bottom

Progression
1. Choose at least 3 different songs
   - Able to choose as much music as you want
   - See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music">YouTube Audio Library</a>
2. Case Study: what will your music player GUI look like?
   - 2D Shapes: how will this look (<a href="https://www.google.ca/search?safe=strict&rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA818CA818&tbm=isch&q=music+players+graphical+user+interfaces&backchip=online_chips:mobile+app&chips=q:music+players+graphical+user+interfaces,online_chips:design,online_chips:android,online_chips:apps&usg=AI4_-kTo8kS0TYqTQ7BMuBziGSFXpEh62Q&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJ6NiK2cXeAhUmilQKHcSLARsQ3VYIKCgA&biw=1920&bih=889&dpr=1">Google Search 20181109</a>)
   - Images
   - Text
   - Buttons
   - Reminder: colour fits into all above
   - Reminder: buttons can be any of the above
3. Case Study Addition: sound effects
   - Buttons: what will some sound effects be (user feedback)
   - Opening and Closing the Music Player: what will this sound like?

# Ideas to Include
Choose Music & Sound Effects
- Minimum 3 songs, content must be owned or freeware
- Choose or record sound effects

GUI to use as example
-
-

Progression
1. Create GitHub Repository for Music Player (Student Personal Account)
2. Begin a Case Study
   - GUI Design
   - Associated Behaviors: minimum are play, stop, next, previous
     - This code will create basis for rest of library and other behaviors
     - Examples: volume, pause, shuffle, show time (total, elapsed), add music (file IO)
  - Minimum 5 other behaviors needed in a music player
3. Layout GUI with rectangles
   - include other 2D Shapes as necessary
   - might start as functions without parameters, all comments out until parameters added
   - See Image
     - ```81H4RVC1TsL._SL1500_.jpg```, <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81H4RVC1TsL._SL1500_.jpg">Click Here for URL</a>
   - Start with Pseudo Code & Comments (add parameters afterwards)
   - 
. Layout Button interaction with rect()
  - will need to "turn on and off over lapping rectangles"
  - colour code rect() GUI layout and button-rect() layout to see differences in GUI
. Prototyping Pieces
  - Play stop one sound effect
  - Play-Stop two sound effects (dependent on different buttons)
  - Play-Stop one song
  - Play-Stop two separate songs
  - Next-Previous song (array introduction)
  - Deal with "Array Index out of Bounds Error"
